# Game Flow

1. **Starting the Game:**
   - Each player starts with 8 pieces.
   - The player with the white pieces goes first.

2. **Taking Turns:**
   - On their turn, the white player selects one of black's pieces and gives it to black to place on the board.
   - Black then chooses where to place the piece on the board.
   - After placing the piece, it becomes black's turn to select a piece for white to place on the board.
   - Players continue alternating turns in this manner.

3. **Game Progression:**
   - The game continues until a player meets one of the win conditions.
